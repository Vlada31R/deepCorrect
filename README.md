**As explored in https://medium.com/@praneethbedapudi/deepcorrection-3-spell-correction-and-simple-grammar-correction-d033a52bc11d , the original aim of this repo is to do spell + simple grammar + punctuation correction. But, since I realised that doing spell correction with seq2seq using autogenerated data is a very dumb idea, I didn't provide usable checkpoints for the same.**

**This repo was originally meant to be experimental and is very inefficient for punctuation restoration/ correction.**

# @harikodali is working on faster and better punctuation restoration with seq2seq networks at https://github.com/notAI-tech/fastpunct

**Beacause of the above reasons, I am archiving this repo.**



# deepcorrect

Code and checkpoints corresponding to the posts https://medium.com/@praneethbedapudi/deepcorrection-3-spell-correction-and-simple-grammar-correction-d033a52bc11d and https://medium.com/@praneethbedapudi/deepcorrection2-automatic-punctuation-restoration-ac4a837d92d9

Pre-trained models for punctuation correction (trained on google news, wikipedia and tatoeba) are available at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Yd8cJaqfQkrJMbRVWIWtuyo4obTDYu-e

This repo uses a seq2seq model written by me in keras with tensorflow backend. The multi-purpose seq2seq model can be found at https://github.com/bedapudi6788/txt2txt/

Usage:
```
from deepcorrect import DeepCorrect
corrector = DeepCorrect('params_path', 'checkpoint_path')
corrector.correct('hey')
'Hey!'
```

# Installation:

pip install deepcorrect

# Points to Note:

Max input and output lengths are 200

Segment text into sentences using https://github.com/bedapudi6788/deepsegment and run punctuation correction on each sentence seperately.
